          <p>Commonwealth and Council is a gallery in Koreatown, Los Angeles. We are an intergenerational community of artists extending our multiple realities through the shared experience of art. Our goal is to explore how generosity and hospitality can sustain our co-existence. Since 2010, our program has supported counter-histories of women, queers, artists of color, and our allies.</p>
